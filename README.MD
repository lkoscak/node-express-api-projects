# Node/Express projects

#### Number of little projects I created following Udemy course by John Smilga (https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-tutorial-and-projects-course/) while learning backend web development in javascript.

Each project has a 'starter' folder which is my solution (added comments and some modifications) and 'final' folder provided with course for reference.
